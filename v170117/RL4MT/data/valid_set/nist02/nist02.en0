zhang qiyue only repeatedly accused the us of " doing a series of things that violate the three joint communiques between china and the us " within a short period of one month after president bush 's visit to china and demanded that the us " stop using the issue of taiwan to interfere in china 's internal affairs . "
on the other hand , in washington d.c. , the us ignored on wednesday china 's warning that a " chilly wind " is blowing over the sino-us relations and insisted that there is nothing wrong with the us permission of taiwan 's defense minister to attend " us-taiwan defense summit " held in florida .
beijing repeatedly attacked the us for issuing a visa to taiwan 's defense minister tang yiau-ming earlier this month and allowing him to attend a conference sponsored by the us arms manufacturers .
tang yiau-ming also met with two senior us officials at the time .
at a routine press conference , state department spokesman boucher was hounded by reporters asking about china 's complaints over this issue , but obviously he was trying his best to avoid a battle of words with china .
he said : " after this meeting , our position is well-known to all .
if you want to ask me about this every day , i am willing to explain it every day . if china wants to ask about this every day , we are willing to explain it every day . "
he said : " the position hasn 't changed . these are our normal contacts with the taiwanese . we will continue to do so . "
zhang qiyue also confirmed yesterday the russian media 's report , saying that the chinese president jiang zemin called the russian president putin by phone at his request the night before , and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between china and russia based on mutual benefits .
both sides believe it is in the interest of both nations and peoples to develop mutually beneficial cooperations between china and russia .
