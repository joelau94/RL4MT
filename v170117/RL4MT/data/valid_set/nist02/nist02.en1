zhang qiyue merely accused the us side for repeatedly ' violating the promises laid out in the three sino-us joint communiques in a series of moves ' just within a month after bush 's china visit . she also requested the us side ' to stop using the taiwan issue in meddling china 's internal affairs . '
on the other side , in washington on wednesday , the us paid no attention to china 's warning about the ' icy breeze ' being blown over sino-us relations . us insisted that there is nothing wrong to allow taiwan 's defense minister to attend the ' us-taiwan defense summit ' in florida .
beijing has criticized us repeatedly in granting visa to taiwan 's defense minister tang yiauming for attending a conference organized by the us weapons industry earlier this month .
tang yiauming also met two us senior officials during his time in us .
in a news briefing , the state department spokesman boucher was questioned by reporters about china 's protests against this matter . however , he apparently tried to avoid opening up a verbal battle with china .
he said , " after this conference , our position is clear to all .
if you want to ask me about this matter every day , i am willing to explain it every day . if china wants to ask this matter every day , we are willing to explain it every day . "
he said , " the position has never changed . this is our normal contact with the people of taiwan and we will keep on doing it . "
zhang qiyue also confirmed yesterday a report by the russian media that president jiang zemin was requested by russian president putin to hold a telephone conversation with him the night before . the two sides exchanged opinions on the issue of sino-russian mutual cooperation .
both sides do believe that carrying out sino-russian mutual cooperation is in the interest of both countries and their people .
