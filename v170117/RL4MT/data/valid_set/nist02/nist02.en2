zhang qiyue just repeated accusations that the us " has done a series of things in violation of the three joint communiques between china and the us " within only one month following bush 's visit to china , and requested that the us " stop interfering in china 's internal affairs with the taiwan issue . "
in another development , in washington on wednesday the us paid no attention to china 's warning that " cold wind " is blowing on sino-us relations and insisted that it is not improper to permit taiwan 's defence minister to attend the " us-taiwan defence summit " held in florida .
beijing has repeatedly hit out at the us issuing visa to taiwanese defence minister tang yiau-ming earlier this month to attend the meeting hosted by the us arms dealers .
tang yiau-ming also met with two senior officials of the us government at that time .
richard boucher , spokesman for the us state department was questioned by journalists at the regular press conference on china 's protest of the issue , but he apparently tried to avoid squabble with china .
he said , " our stance is known to everyone after the meeting . "
" if you would ask me about the issue everyday , i would like to explain it everyday . if china would ask about the issue everyday , we would explain it everyday . "
he said , " our stance has not changed . these are normal contacts between us and the taiwanese and we will continue to do so . "
zhang qiyue yesterday also confirmed the russian press reports that chinese president jiang zemin had a phone call with russian president putin at the request of the latter , and the two sides exchanged views on cooperation between china and russia based on mutual benefit . "
both sides believed that the cooperation between china and russia on mutual benefit is in the interest of both the countries and their people .
